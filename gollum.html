        <div id="intro"><p>Gollum originally was a human-like being who discovered the Ring of Power at the bottom of a lake on a fishing trip several hundred years before the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings events.  The ring influenced him to do evil things such as murder his friend to keep him from taking it. It also transformed him physically into a strange creature, and elongated his lifespan.  Bilbo baggins accidentally steals the ring from him during The Hobbit, and for this reason Gollum hates bilbo, and it becomes Gollums mission to get back the ring.</p></div>
