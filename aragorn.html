        <div id="intro"><p>Aragorn is a human, and the heir to the Throne of Gondor and the Numenor Kings of Old.  His ancestor, Isildor, defeated Sauron during the second age, however instead of destroying the Ring of Power, he kept it, and it ultimately led to his death and the end of his dynasty.  Isildor's descendants live in exile for many generations until Aragorn is able to unite the Kingdoms of Men to defeat Sauron, and also helps frodo destroy the Ring of Power</p></div>
